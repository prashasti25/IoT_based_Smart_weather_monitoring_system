# IoT_based_Smart_weather_monitoring_system
The whole circuit designing is done on TinkerCAD. Whatever data, the sensors sensed will be sent to the Thingspeak through using HTTP call.
A MATLAB analysis is also done that gives the maximum and minimum sensed data of the past 24 hours.
The report of the whole project, Arduino code, and MATLAB analysis code is attached in the repository.
